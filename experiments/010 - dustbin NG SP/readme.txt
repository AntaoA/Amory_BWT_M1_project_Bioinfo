Experiment regarding order (lexico, random, phylo) on a set of genomes from dustbin, NG and SP.
Objective: combining dustbin (non-organization) and NG and SP (organization) in order to look if there are a positive impact of phylogenetic order over random and lexicographic order.
Methods: Same as before (009 experiment for example)
