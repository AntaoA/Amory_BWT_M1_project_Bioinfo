I try to make a transformation using ropebwt3 on a collection of string.
Here, I will go to try with the folder wolbachia_endosymbiont_of_drosophila_melanogaster__01 from 661k database.
The folder contain 116 files and the weight is: 133.9Mio

ropebwt3

    cat test.txt | ropebwt3 build -Ld - > test.fmr
    ropebwt3 get test.fmr n : if n = 2i, get the i-th sequence, else n = 2i+1, get the reverse complement of the i-th sequence.
